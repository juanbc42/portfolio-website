# Portfolio Website

This is the repo of my personal website repository.

The goal is to have a static website, with the content being my background on tech, and serving it through good technologies. 

After having the content, the goal is to serve it through Google Cloud (free tier), along with other free tier resources. 

## Static website
The website will be built using handlebars, less, bootstrap, and some Vanilla JS

## Platform
The website will be hosted on a GCE (google compute engine); 
served through a free CDN (to be defined);
using free dns server (to be defined);
with a free domain, and secure (HTTPS, ssl certificate from let's encrypt);

A comprehensive list of the free items is a WIP. 

## Goal
The goal is to actually do a parallel project to learn the necessary steps to put a website live, and using something from Google Cloud platform, even if it is the basic GCE VMs. And to use the static website as a real personal website. 

## Future
Improve Analytics, SEO, infra, and content management.
